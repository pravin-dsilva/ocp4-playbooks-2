Deploy RSCT/RMC on an OCP Cluster on PowerVM
=========

These instructions will help you deploy the RSCT/RMC daemonset on an OCP cluster running on PowerVM:

**1. Setting up the inventory**

Use the instructions provided [here](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-playbooks#setting-up-inventory) to setup the inventory for your cluster. For deploying RSCT, you would only need to set the bastion host details in the inventory.

Provide the hostname or the IP address of the bastion node in the inventory. An example of the inventory file would look like this:

```
$ cat inventory
[bastion]
192.168.26.155 ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root
```

**2. Set up the variables**

Make use of the sample file at examples/rmc_vars.yaml.

```
cp examples/rmc_vars.yaml .
```

**3. Run the playbook to deploy RSCT**

The ocp-customization [module](https://github.com/ocp-power-automation/ocp4-playbooks/tree/master/playbooks/roles/ocp-customization) is used to deploy RSCT/RMC daemonset on the cluster.

```
ansible-playbook -i inventory -e @rmc_vars.yaml playbooks/customization.yaml
```

**4. Post deployment checks**

After the playbook execution completes, the daemonset and pods should be available in the `powervm-rmc` namespace on the cluster. Run the following command to list them:

```
oc get daemonset,pods -n powervm-rmc
```
